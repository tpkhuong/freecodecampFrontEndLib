Getting Started with React Redux
This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React. First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology.
React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way.
Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state.
Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app.
Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role.
Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.

Although React components can manage their own state locally, when you have a complex app, it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux.
There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box,
you need to use the react-redux package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux state and dispatch to your React components as props.

Over the next few challenges, first, you'll create a simple React component which allows you to input new text messages.
These are added to an array that's displayed in the view. This should be a nice review of what you learned in the React lessons.
Next, you'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array. Finally, you'll use react-redux to connect the Redux store with your component,
thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.

Extract State Logic to Redux
Now that you finished the React component, you need to move the logic it's performing locally in its state into Redux. This is the first step to connect the simple React app to Redux.
The only functionality your app has is to add new messages from the user to an unordered list. The example is simple in order to demonstrate how React and Redux work together.

Use Provider to Connect Redux to React
In the last challenge, you created a Redux store to handle the messages array and created an action for adding new messages.
The next step is to provide React access to the Redux store and the actions it needs to dispatch updates. React Redux provides its react-redux package to help accomplish these tasks.

React Redux provides a small API with two key features: Provider and connect. Another challenge covers connect.
The Provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux store and dispatch functions throughout your component tree.
Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the Provider for an App component might look like this:

<Provider store={store}>
  <App/>
</Provider>

Map State to Props
The Provider component allows you to provide state and dispatch to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want.
This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. You accomplish this by creating two functions: mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().

In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch.
Once these functions are in place, you'll see how to use the React Redux connect method to connect them to your components in another challenge.

Note: Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the store.subscribe() method to implement mapStateToProps().

<!-- 

Create a function mapStateToProps(). This function should take state as an argument, then return an object which maps that state to specific property names.
These properties will become accessible to your component via props. Since this example keeps the entire state of the app in a single array,
you can pass that entire state to your component. Create a property messages in the object that's being returned, and set it to state.

 -->

<!-- 

Map Dispatch to Props
The mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store.
It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props.
However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data.
You have access to this dispatch because it's passed in to mapDispatchToProps() as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed state to mapStateToProps().
Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to conduct these dispatches with mapDispatchToProps().
This is similar to how it uses store.subscribe() for components that are mapped to state.

For example, you have a loginUser() action creator that takes a username as an action payload. The object returned from mapDispatchToProps() for this action creator would look something like:

{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}

 -->

Connect Redux to React
Now that you've written both the mapStateToProps() and the mapDispatchToProps() functions, you can use them to map state and dispatch to the props of one of your React components.
The connect method from React Redux can handle this task. This method takes two optional arguments, mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().
They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to state but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.

To use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:

connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)

Note: If you want to omit one of the arguments to the connect method, you pass null in its place.

Connect Redux to the Messages App
Now that you understand how to use connect to connect React to Redux, you can apply what you've learned to your React component that handles messages.

In the last lesson, the component you connected to Redux was named Presentational, and this wasn't arbitrary.
This term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux. They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive.
By contrast, container components are connected to Redux.
These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.
