<!-- ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode) -->

<!-- 

    The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page.
    You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById()
    to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.
 -->

<!-- 
So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.

One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes.
This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase.
For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

<!-- 
For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component.
The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it,
but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that
React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX

   -->

<!-- 

// After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};    

-->

<!-- // Change code below this line class MyComponent extends React.Component{
constructor(props){ super(props) } render(){ return (
<div>
  <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
</div>
) } } ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />,
document.querySelector("#challenge-node")); -->

<!-- 

    const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line

var JSX = <div>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>World</p>
<p>!</p>
</div>

return JSX;

  // Change code above this line
}
    -->

<!-- 

        The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class.
So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet,
they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super().
It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects
that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.
For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.
     -->

<!-- 

        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello React!</h1>
  </div>
)


    // Change code above this line
  }
};
      -->

<!-- 

        Create a Component with Composition
Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children.
To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example),
it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.
       -->

<!-- 

        const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <ChildComponent />

        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
        -->

<!-- 
    Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in
    terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components.
    This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the
    development and maintenance of complex projects.
         -->

<!-- 

    You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.
-->

<!-- 

    Render a Class Component to the DOM
You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process for rendering React components will look very similar.
The past few challenges focused on components and composition,
so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). The first argument is the React component that you want to render.
The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render.

However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode).

*** the < /> IMPORTANT when using ReactDOM.render()***

You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

 -->

<!-- 

Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components, and ES6 style class components in React.
With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: props. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components.
Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome.
Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX.
You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

<!-- 
Pass an Array as Props
The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information from a parent component to a child component as props or properties.
This challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as props. To pass an array to a JSX element,
it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
</ParentComponent>
The child component then has access to the array property colors. Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property.
const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p> This will join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce:
<p>green, blue, red</p> Later, we will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.

  { /* Change code below this line */ }

        <h2>Today</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <List tasks={["walk dog", "wash dog"]}/>
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={["feed dog", "play with dog", "teach dog"]}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};    

 -->

<!-- 

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary.
This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' },
you have defined a location prop that's set to the string San Francisco,
unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null.

const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
  return (

    </div>
  )

// Change code below this line

ShoppingCard.defaultProps = {items: 0}

 -->

<!-- 
React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. 
For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop.
You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps.
Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }

In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. Adding isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component.
You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the
only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the
documentation for all of the options.

Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

  -->

<!-- 

    Access Props Using this.props
The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components.
But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component?
The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this.
For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

    Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components
Except for the last challenge, you've been passing props to stateless functional components. These components act like pure functions.
They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props.
You may be wondering what state is, and the next challenge will cover it in more detail. Before that, here's a review of the terminology for components.

A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component,
but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state.
You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application.
In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.

<!-- 

Create a Stateful Component
One of the most important topics in React is state. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time.
You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created.
The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:

this.state = {
  // describe your state here
}
You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components.
The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

  -->

<!--


Render State in the User Interface
Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered.
If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method.
You can access the data with this.state.

If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.

State is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data.
If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates,
it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary.
This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component,
unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic,
then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

 -->

<!-- 

Render State in the User Interface Another Way
There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly.
For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props,
perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

 -->

<!-- 

    Set State with this.setState
The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in the constructor. There is also a way to change the component's state.
React provides a method for updating component state called setState. You call the setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs.
The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a username in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur.
Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous.
There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the
React documentation for further details.

 -->

<!-- 

Bind 'this' to a Class Method
In addition to setting and updating state, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can access properties on the class
(such as state and props) inside the scope of the method.
There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access this.

One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized.
You may have noticed the last challenge used this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this) for its handleClick method in the constructor.
Then, when you call a function like this.setState() within your class method, this refers to the class and will not be undefined.

Note: The this keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript but it plays an important role in React. Although its behavior here is totally normal,
these lessons aren't the place for an in-depth review of this so please refer to other lessons if the above is confusing!    

  -->

<!-- 

Use State to Toggle an Element
Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update.
This means you can't rely on the previous value of this.state or this.props when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:

this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
});
Instead, you should pass setState a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props.
This means that the above should be rewritten as:

this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
You can also use a form without props if you need only the state:

this.setState(state => ({
  counter: state.counter + 1
}));
Note that you have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.

Create a Controlled Form
The last challenge showed that React can control the internal state for certain elements like input and textarea, which makes them controlled components.
This applies to other form elements as well, including the regular HTML form element.

The MyForm component is set up with an empty form with a submit handler. The submit handler will be called when the form is submitted.

We've added a button which submits the form. You can see it has the type set to submit indicating it is the button controlling the form.
Add the input element in the form and set its value and onChange() attributes like the last challenge. You should then complete the handleSubmit method so that it sets
the component state property submit to the current input value in the local state.

Note: You also must call event.preventDefault() in the submit handler, to prevent the default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page.

Finally, create an h1 tag after the form which renders the submit value from the component's state. You can then type in the form and click the button (or press enter),
and you should see your input rendered to the page.

Pass State as Props to Child Components
You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges.
You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components.
You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information,
but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components,
from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few,
or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation
where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles.
When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

Pass a Callback as Props
You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component.
This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components.
You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component.
These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update,
before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main
lifecycle methods: componentWillMount() componentDidMount() shouldComponentUpdate() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount()
The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.

Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17. (Source)
    
 -->

<!-- 

Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount
Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount().
This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component.
When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
 -->

<!-- 

Add Event Listeners
The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality.
React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers.
This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements.
However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.    
  -->

<!-- 

Attach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress().
You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

Then, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener().
It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.

 -->

<!-- 

Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate
So far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay.
But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not.
The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.

This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed.
You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component.
You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.

Introducing Inline Styles
There are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code.
But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML
because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet.
Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

<div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>

JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>

Notice how we camelCase the "fontSize" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

 -->

<!-- 

Add Inline Styles in React
You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object.
First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case.
For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties,
so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em,
for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: "4em"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.

  -->
<!-- 

    const styles = {
      color: "purple",
      fontSize: 40,
      border: "2px solid purple"
    }
// Change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return (
      <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
};

 -->

<!-- 

Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method
In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state,
inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components.
These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.

You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces.
This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.

Render with an If-Else Condition
Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders.
When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

 -->

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.setState((state) => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }

    // Change code below this line

    if(this.state.display === true){
      return (

         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         <h1>Displayed!</h1>

      return (

         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
       </div>
    );
    }
  }
};

 -->

<!-- 

 Use && for a More Concise Conditional
The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result.
Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions.
If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error.
Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true,
and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

{condition && <p>markup</p>}

If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing.
You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex
conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code

 -->

<!-- 

Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering
Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator.
The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements,
but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code.
You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement.
Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts,
but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

Render Conditionally from Props
So far, you've seen how to use if/else, &&, null and the ternary operator (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when.
However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props.
Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.

In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator,
but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.

Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State
At this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles.
Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component.
To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.

This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly
(which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly.
It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition,
you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state.
There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React

Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements
Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming,
a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program.
Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.

For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list.
You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.

answer is in app.js
 -->

<!-- 

Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute
The last challenge showed how the map method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input.
However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value.
React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

Note: Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.

  -->

<!-- 

Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array
The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React.
Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array.
For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:

let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);

Render React on the Server with renderToString
So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do.
However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server.
Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.

There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app.
First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser.
This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client,
the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because
the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.

Register a Store Listener
Another method you have access to on the Redux store object is store.subscribe(). This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store,

One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.
