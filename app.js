Challenge 1
Create a function createFunction that creates and returns a function. When that created function is called,
it should print "hello". When you think you completed createFunction, un-comment out those lines in the code and run it to see if it works.

Challenge 2
Create a function createFunctionPrinter that accepts one input and returns a function.
When that created function is called, it should print out the input that was used when the function was created.

Challenge 3
Examine the code for the outer function. Notice that we are returning a function and that function is using variables that are outside of its scope.
Uncomment those lines of code. Try to deduce the output before executing. Now we are going to create a function addByX that returns a function that will add an input by x.
