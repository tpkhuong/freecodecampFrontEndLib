<!-- ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode) -->

<!-- 

    The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page.
    You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById()
    to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.
 -->

<!-- 
So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.

One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes.
This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase.
For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

<!-- 
For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component.
The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it,
but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that
React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX

   -->

<!-- 

// Change code below this line

class MyComponent extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent/>, document.querySelector("#challenge-node"));    

 -->

<!-- 

    const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line

var JSX = <div>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>World</p>
<p>!</p>
</div>

return JSX;

  // Change code above this line
}
    -->

<!-- 

        The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class.
So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet,
they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super().
It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects
that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.
For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.
     -->

<!-- 

        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello React!</h1>
  </div>
)


    // Change code above this line
  }
};
      -->

<!-- 

        Create a Component with Composition
Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children.
To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example),
it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.
       -->

<!-- 

        const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <ChildComponent />

        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
        -->

<!-- 
    Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in
    terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components.
    This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the
    development and maintenance of complex projects.
         -->

<!-- 

    You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.
-->

<!-- 

    Render a Class Component to the DOM
You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process for rendering React components will look very similar.
The past few challenges focused on components and composition,
so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). The first argument is the React component that you want to render.
The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render.

However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode).

*** the < /> IMPORTANT when using ReactDOM.render()***

You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

 -->

<!-- 

Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components, and ES6 style class components in React.
With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: props. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components.
Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome.
Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX.
You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

    super(props);

<!-- 
Pass an Array as Props
The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information from a parent component to a child component as props or properties.
This challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as props. To pass an array to a JSX element,
it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
</ParentComponent>
The child component then has access to the array property colors. Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property.
const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p> This will join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce:
<p>green, blue, red</p> Later, we will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.

const List = (props) => {
  { /* Change code below this line */ }

        <h2>Today</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <List tasks={["walk dog", "wash dog"]}/>
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={["feed dog", "play with dog", "teach dog"]}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};    

 -->

<!-- 

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary.
This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' },
you have defined a location prop that's set to the string San Francisco,
unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null.

ShoppingCard.defaultProps = {items: 0}

 -->

<!-- 
React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. 
For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop.
You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps.
Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }

In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. Adding isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component.
You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the
only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the
documentation for all of the options.

Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

    Access Props Using this.props
The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components.
But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component?
The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this.
For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

    Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components
Except for the last challenge, you've been passing props to stateless functional components. These components act like pure functions.
They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props.
You may be wondering what state is, and the next challenge will cover it in more detail. Before that, here's a review of the terminology for components.

A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component,
but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state.
You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application.
In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.

Create a Stateful Component
One of the most important topics in React is state. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time.
You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created.
The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:

this.state = {
  // describe your state here
}
You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components.
The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.
